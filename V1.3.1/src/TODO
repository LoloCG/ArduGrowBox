TODO: 
CRITICAL:
    [ ]-Check code that can be improved to save RAM usage
        [ ]-Optimize MainMenu function
    [ ]-Check what is wrong with Soil humidity control
        It seems to work, but takes time to open, and displays humidity for low amount of time
    [ ]-Check what is wrong with Menu not working properly
    [X]-Implement bounceback in button function

Important:
    [ ]-VPD Fan speed control
        through the logging of airdata function in main loop:
        [ ]-If high temperature --> increase Extractor speed
        [ ]-If High temperature and high humidity --> increase intake fan

    [ ]-Include in buttonpress function, detection of long or short press
    W[ ]-Include humidity control through activation of humidifier
        Wait until obtaining humidifier
    [ ]-

Meh:
    [ ]-Implement day/night cycle fan change   
        For disabling fans at night unless high variation of VPD.
        Or maybe set only to low speeds the fans.
        This will help reduce noise at night and save energy.
    [ ]-Add in the humidity check the time of last watering
        Maybe through opening the .txt file and reading it somehow?
    [ ]-Add option to change VPD ranges
        for seedlings, vegging and flowering stages maybe?
    [ ]-Add water level sensor in the watering bucket
        Maybe could be added as the attiny85 standalone module
    
Maybe:
    [ ]-Add #define and #ifndef to each thing to modify what is used in the code
    [ ]-improve manual fan control
        maybe add a system that overrides manual if VPD range is thrown off too high...
    [ ]-Otion to only water at night or other option..
        not sure if watering at night is better than during day...

For future versions:
    [ ]- Change from LCD screen to OLED display
